    <h1>About the Website</h1>
      <p>Bayern Munich Profiles is a website for all soccer fans who are interested to learn more about players of FC Bayern Munich. Players are categorized by their position. Each player's page includes their basic information, description of their background, the statistics for their previous season, and my personal interpretation of the player's play style.</p>
      <h2>Player Positions</h2>
      <p>Below are the soccer positions. Two-letter abbreviations are followed by the position's full name. In all player profiles, positions are listed as abbreviations. In each player's profile, the positions are listed in order - from the most preferable to the least of the ones that a player is capable of playing.</p>

      <h2>Player Statistics</h2>
        <p>Because the 2022-23 soccer season was still in progress during the development of this website, all player's statistics kept changing from week to week as they play more games. For that reason, all profiles on this website have statistics for the players' previous season - 2021-22. If a player played for a different club last season, this information was included in the statistics section as well.</p>
