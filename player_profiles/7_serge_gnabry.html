            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Serge Gnabry is a talented soccer player who has all the necessary skills as a winger. The exceptional attributes that he offers to Bayern are his speed, dribbling, and finishing ability. His speed is acceptable for a winger of a world class level. Player in RW or LW positions are expected to have great speed, and Gnabry satisfies that expectation. His agility and acceleration on the ball has the potential to leave any defender behind. Gnabry's speed, however, is complemented well by his dribbling skills. He might not be the fastest of the wingers in the world, but his footwork makes him stand out. Gnabry doesn't have to be the fastest, as his dribbling alone is enough to leave the defender behind. His speed is just an extra tool to ensure that the defenders don't catch up and tackle him. Lastly, what makes Gnabry a true Bayern-worthy player is his finishing ability. He is known to score goals from all angles and distances, with both feet. Gnabry is one of the players who the teammates can rely on to convert the chances they create. This trait makes him a good option at almost all offensive positions, and Bayern have been successfully using this trait when the need arises. All together, his speed, dribbling, and finishing, work very well in unison to make Gnabry a reliable all-round attacking player for Bayern Munich.</p>
