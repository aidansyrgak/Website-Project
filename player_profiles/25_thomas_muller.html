            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Thomas Muller is a unique player who utilizes his mental ability more than physical one. Even though Muller possesses an incredible stamina and endurance, he is not exceptional in all other conventional areas of soccer. Muller is an awkward dribbler, average passer, not particularly quick or strong, and his finishing ability is just good enough for a forward of a professional level. Nevertheless, he has been a set-in-stone starter for Bayern Munich for over a decade. That is due to his spectacular ability to control space. He is famous for calling himself a "Raumdeuter", which from German translates to "Space Interpreter". He has an eye for open spaces and weak spots in opposing teams' defense. Muller utilizes this ability to make runs into these spaces, which often results in promising attacking plays. Additionally, he uses this space-interpreting ability to create chances for his teammates. Muller often makes fake "dummy" runs behind the opposition defense, which turns the attention of the defenders to him. This, in turn, creates free spaces for other teammates to run into. Muller's ability is one that's easy to undervalue, since he isn't the one scoring goals or making flashy moves. However, his consistent proclivity to elevate the team from the shadows has deservedly earned him the recognition as one of the legends of Bayern Munich and the world of soccer in general.</p>
