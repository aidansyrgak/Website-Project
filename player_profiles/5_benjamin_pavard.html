            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Benjamin Pavard is known for his versatility and consistency. As a defender, Pavard is able to play both as a CB and a RB. He is tall enough for a typical CB. He is able to head the ball and defend crosses. His strongest suit as a CB, however, is his tactical awareness and positioning. Pavard is not as strong or quick as other defenders at Bayern Munich, but he compensates for that with his strategic thinking. He knows how to make the best decision in a difficult situation. He is phenomenal at timing the ball, knowing when to commit and intercept or when to be patient and passive. Pavard's spacial awareness and positioning are also beneficial at CB. He is able to play the opposition forwards offside or be in the right place at the right time to defend any dangerous passes. What makes him stand out as a world class player, however, is his ability to also play as a RB, which is rare for CBs. In fact, Pavard's performances as a RB have been so impressive, that he became Bayern's preferred starting player at that position. His defensive ability as a CB helps him to lock down Bayern's right flank. However, he is also able to constantly run up and down the field, just like a conventional RB. Pavard knows how to overlap with the wingers and work together with Bayern's forwards. He can also put in good crosses into the opposition box and even be an outlet for the crosses himself. His ability to head the ball has been useful in situations when the ball is passed high. Pavard is a great influence for Bayern Munich, being able to excel in more than one position and help the team both defensively and offensively.</p>
