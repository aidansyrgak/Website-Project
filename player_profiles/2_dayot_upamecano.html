            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Dayot Upamecano is a young player who possesses all the necessary qualities to be a world-class defender. He is quick, he is tall, and he is strong. All these attributes are helpful in defense. Upamecano is able to out-jump opposition forwards to head the ball away. His speed and strength help him to out-muscle and tackle the ball from players who try to run behind Bayern's defense. His natural physical talent also helps Bayern to progress the ball forward from defense to attack. It is very difficult for players to stop someone with so much raw power. For Upamecano, it is often enough to just run forward with the ball in order to pass the opposition. Nevertheless, being a young player, Upamecano has a tendency to make mistakes, which he is often criticized for. His decision-making needs improvement, as he often misplaces his passes or takes too much time on the ball, which results in turnovers. Additionally, being so reliant on his physical attributes, he has trouble defending against forwards who are even bigger and faster than him. No matter how strong you are, there will always be someone who is stronger. In these situations, Upamecano lacks the necessary experience to come up with strategies that can deal with physically superior forwards. However, there is no doubt that Upamecano can polish his game with more playing time and exposure to difficult situations.</p>
