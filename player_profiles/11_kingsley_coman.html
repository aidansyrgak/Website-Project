            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Kingsley Coman plays exclusively as a winger in RW or LW positions. As a sterotypical winger, he possesses incredible speed. He usually beats defenders using his acceleration alone, without having to resort to dribbling. However, his driblling ability is exceptional as well. Together with his speed, he uses feints to send a defender one way, and then zooms the other way, inveitably leaving the defender behind. Coman's 1v1 ability is extremely helpful for the team, as he can effortlessly get into the opposition box and create dangerous chances. His defensive contribution is noticeable as well. He is adept at pressuring the ball and is willing to run back to help the defenders.</p>
