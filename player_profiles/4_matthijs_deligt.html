            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Matthijs De Ligt is a defender who embodies Bayern Munich's philosophy. Like all top defenders, he is tall and strong, which helps him to take the ball away from opposition forwards. His height and ability to jump is very helpful during set pieces. He can score header goals and defend crosses. However, what makes him a perfect fit for Bayern is his attacking impact. Bayern is an attacking team, and all players are expected to contribute offensively. Matthijs De Ligt is known for his background as a midfielder. Thus, he possesses the passing ability, dribbling, and composure of a midfielder. De Ligt is comfortable on the ball, being able to play when pressured by opposition forwards. In contrast to other defenders, who just kick the ball as far away from their goal as possible, De Ligt can calmly make the best possible decision. This can be a pass or a dribbling move that dissolves the opposition pressure and results in a forward progression of the ball. De Ligt is a big and intimidating defender who has great skills on the ball, which makes him a great all-round player at Bayern Munich.</p>
