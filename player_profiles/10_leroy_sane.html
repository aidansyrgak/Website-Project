            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Leroy Sane is a world-class winger who can deliver top offensive performances for Bayern Munich. His style of play corresponds to that of a conventional winger. Since coming to Bayern Munich, however, Sane's style evolved into a modernized version of the flank players. Just as any top winger, Sane has electrifying speed and exceptional dribbling. He is one of the fastest players at Bayern, and he fully utilizes this ability. Sane can beat any defender in 1v1 situations purely with his speed. His speed also allows him to make dangerous runs in behind the opposition defense. Sane's dribbling ability is one of the best in the team as well. Thus, he is not just a winger who is waiting for his teammates to create chances for him. He actively creates chances by himself, going around one or multiple defenders to then make a shot or a promising pass. Playing in advances attacking positions, Sane sometimes drops deep to receive the ball in midfield. He then uses the combination of dribbling and speed to progress the ball into the opposition box. What made Sane's style more modernized, however, are his defensive hustles. Sane was never knows as a player who contributed defensively. Nevertheless, Bayern's style of play requires players to be multi-dimensional, which forces them to adopt new traits. A trait that Sane learned was tracking back into defense, even if that meant running all the way to Bayern's own box. Using his extraordinary pace, Sane has the ability to chase down the opposing players and take the ball away from them. This has helped Bayern on several dangerous turnovers, because the team now had one more player, who is arguably its fastest player, contributing defensively. Sane's near-perfect qualities as a winger and track backs made him a definite starter at Bayern Munich. </p>
