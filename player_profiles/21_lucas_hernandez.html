            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Lucas Hernandez is arguably Bayern's best defender. He might not be the biggest of defenders, but his intensity, aggression, and athleticism make him an extraordinary CB. His pace and agility make him a great LB as well, which is especially helpful when Bayern is plagued with injuries. The aspect of Hernandez's style that set him apart from other defenders is his aggression and anticipation. Hernandez is a warrior on the field who does not hesitate to tackle the ball from any forward. In contrast to more patient defenders, Hernandez instantly comes into close contact with opposing players. He is happy to use his aggression and physicality to out-muscle players. But Hernandez didn't become Bayern's best defender with aggression alone. His exceptional anticipation and decision-making is what justifies his warrior-like style of play. Defenders who rely on aggression often find themselves fouling too much and getting sent off with a red card. Hernandez, however, uses his anticipation to perfectly time his close contact duels. Thus, his tackles and interceptions rarely result in fouls, because they're usually executed within soccer's rules. So, even though Hernandez might seem too aggressive, he makes sure that he picks the right moment before going all in. Hernandez is also an exemplary LB, having won the World Cup playing in that position. His defensive attributes as a CB help him a lot at the LB position. He can also run up and down the pitch, making great overlapping runs and helping Bayern's offense by stretching he opposition defense. All in all, Hernandez's brave and aggressive style in addition to position-based versatility make him one of the greatest defenders in today's world of soccer.</p>
