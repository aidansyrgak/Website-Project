            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Joshua Kimmich is one of the most versatile players in Bayern Munich. His skill set is vast, and he can play a variety of roles, from defense to midfield. Currently, his main position in Bayern Munich is DM - defensive midfielder. Kimmich has a phenomenal ability to retain the ball under pressure. His composure on the ball and dribbling helps him to avoid opposition players who are actively pressuring him for the entire duration of the game. During attacking phases, Kimmich is positioned just above the opposition box to help distribute the ball with his accurate passing. He also sets the tempo for the team, deciding whether Bayern should play quick and direct or slowly control the ball. In defensive phases, Kimmich is a big presence in the middle of the field. He intercepts passes, tackles, pressures the ball, and even retreats to the back line to help Bayern's defenders. Kimmich is able to handle this much responsibility both in attack and defense with his incomparable stamina. He is one the players who runs the most in the team. Considered to be the heart of Bayern, his stamina allows him to start almost every game of the season. Kimmich is famous for his mentality as well. He is one of the leaders in the team who never surrenders and sets high standards for himself and all his teammates.</p>
