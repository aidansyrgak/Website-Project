            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Alphonso Davies is known at Bayern Munich as the "Roadrunner". He is the fastest player in Bayern, and maybe even in the German Bundesliga. Being a youngster among other Bayern players, he is not experienced enough to be outstanding in many aspects. He is infamous for his speed alone, and it proved to be enough to earn him a spot as a starter at LB position. As an offense-oriented team, Bayern play an extremely high back line, which make turnovers very dangerous for the team. That is when Alphonso Davies' speed proved to be the most useful, as he can single-handedly remove that threat. Davies is able to chase down and take the ball from anyone during turnovers. This allows Bayern to keep playing with a high line and consistency be an attacking threat. All the players of the field are confident that if anything goes wrong, Davies has got their back with his incomparable pace. Nevertheless, one cannot be a world-class player with one exceptional trait alone. Davies sometimes finds himself struggling in defensive situations. Speed is not the most important trait when it comes to fully defensive phases out of possession. Abilities like spacial awareness, positioning, anticipation, and decision-making are a lot more important, and that is what Davies lacks as a LB. He struggles against dribblers who use feints and footwork to get away from him. Additionally, his lack of awareness makes him play the opposing forwards onside, which results in dangerous situations. However, the skills necessary to be a great defender come with time. Thus, fans have no doubt that Davies will be able to evolve into a truly world-class defender as he plays more matches and gains more experience.</p>
