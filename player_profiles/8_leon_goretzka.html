            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Leon Goretzka is a complete midfielder who has been a stone-wall starter for Bayern Munich. Goretzka's style of play is known in world of soccer as "box-to-box". These types of players will quite literally run from their own box to the opposition box, covering a great amount of territory during the entire 90 minutes of play. The attribute that makes him complete in CM position is his physicality. He is tall, strong, and fast. Physically, he is built like a CB. Couple that with his ability to excel as a midfielder, and the result is almost a cheat-code. Goretzka's athleticism allows him to dominate the center of the field. He can push the opposition player off the ball, tackle the ball, and chase the players down with his speed. Offensively, he can make quick runs into the box and head the ball into the net, as his height and jumping ability allow him to win aerial duels against most opposing defenders. Goretzka's endurance has to be emphasized as well, because he can keep up his aggressive and physical style of player for the duration of an entire game. His style perfectly complements that of Bayern's other midfielders. The midfielders in Bayern are tasked with controlling the game and creating chances. Goretzka, however, is tasked with ensuring that nothing goes wrong in the process. He is a destroyer on the field, and his athleticism and effectiveness has been crucial in earning Bayern Munich's trophies of the recent years.</p>
