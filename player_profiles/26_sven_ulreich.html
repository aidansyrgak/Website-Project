            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Sven Ulreich has been Bayern's solid backup goalkeeper for a very long time. He has mastered goalkeeping fundamentals, being able to properly block, catch, and kick the ball. He is considered a defensive goalkeeper and doesn't go out of his box as much as Manuel Neuer. Ulreich is often criticized for his mediocre passing, which often led to dangerous situations for the team. However, as a backup goalkeeper, he performs all his duties on the top level and is able to deliver when the team needs him the most.</p>
