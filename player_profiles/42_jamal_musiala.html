            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Jamal Musiala is Bayern Munich's jewel, as he has shown so much brilliance at such a young age. Musiala is a very slick player who has the best dribbling ability in the team. His dribbling is so smooth, that he is able to effortlessly pass through multiple opposing players. Musiala's balance, ball control, and creativity produce a beautiful style of soccer that is appreciated by many fans worldwide. Musiala is very technical on the ball, which makes him a dangerous outlet in attack. With just a few smooth moves and footwork, Musiala can find himself in a goal-scoring opportunity. Additionally, he can almost eliminate Bayern's need for build-up play. His teammates can just pass the ball to him, and he will confidently progress the ball forward by dribbling through the opposing players. However, similar to many youngsters, Musiala is currently one-dimensional. He is only good at dribbling, and lacks some skills that would make him one of the best in the world. His passing needs improvement, as he is often unable to make precise passes when he is put into the midfield. Additionally, Musiala's finishing is unexceptional for a forward, so he needs to work on that if he wants to excel in attacking positions. Most of all, however, he struggles against physical opponents. Athletic and strong players can just push Musiala off the ball, which completely negates his dribbling. Thus, Musiala still has some work to do if he wants to become the top of the top in the world. </p>
