            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Daley Blind is a world-class defender who utilizes his wits more than his athleticism. Physically, Blind is nothing special. He is not tall for a CB, and not fast for fullback positions such as LB or RB. His strength is nothing out of the ordinary, and he has a limited offensive impact. However, what made him a top level defender for decades both at club and international level is his soccer IQ. As a defender, he makes nigh-perfect decisions. He reads the game well and can predict the destination of passes before they are even made, which allows him to intercept the ball from the opposition. Additionally, Blind has remarkable spacial awareness and defensive fundamentals. He knows everything that is happening around him on the field. In combination with his strong defensive fundamentals, he makes very few mistakes. He knows when to perfectly time a tackle, when to be patient, when to play an opposing forward offside, and when to fight for the ball in the air. He is a living proof that defenders don't need to be genetic freaks with insane athletic talent to be successful. Just having a complete mastery of soccer fundamentals can get one very far in the sport. In Bayern, he can play at any position in defense and even in midfield if the team needs more control in defensive phases of the game. Blind's intelligence, mastery, and experience has made him one of the most renowned, consistent, and versatile defenders in the world of soccer.</p>
