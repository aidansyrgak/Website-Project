            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Josip Stanisic is a young defense-oriented fullback who can deliver consistent performances. His all-round qualities make him a great defender. Stanisic is tall, strong, and possesses a high soccer IQ. He is comfortable with engaging in physical duels and not afraid to tackle the ball. His strength and height allow him to dominate opposing forwards and win aerial battles. What makes him unique at such a young age is his intelligence. He plays like he has years of experience behind him. He is patient and doesn't over-commit into tackles, which offers a solid defensive block. His positional awareness is advanced as well, as he is able to keep track of multiple players at the same time and make the best possible decision in whatever situation he is in. Being one of the younger players, Stanisic hasn't earned his spot as a starter yet. There are some aspects of his game which need improvement, especially his offensive output. Bayern is a very attack-minded team, and all players, from forwards to goalkeepers, need to offer at least some offensive contribution. Stanisic is solid defensively, but cannot produce high-quality attacking chances. He needs to keep training, be patient, and prove to the team and the fans that he is able to perform both defensively and offensively if he wants to start at either RB or LB.</p>
