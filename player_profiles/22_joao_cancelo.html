            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Joao Cancelo is one of the best fullbacks in world of soccer. He is able to play on both flanks, being equally good at RB and LB positions. Cancelo is a very attack-minded fullback. His most prominent traits are dribbling and crossing. Cancelo's dribbling helps him to avoid opposition pressure and progress the ball forward. He is very brave and calm when it comes to ball control. Cancelo is not afraid to be in 1v1 situations and is willing to move the ball up by himself instead of passing. Some might consider it  risky to dribble as a defender, since you're positioned very close to your own goal and turnovers become especially dangerous. Cancelo, however, justifies his decisions with successful 1v1s and very rarely causes a turnover. This confidence on the ball and flashy footwork make him a great outlet for forward progression from defense to offense. In offense, Cancelo excels with his precise pinpoint crosses. He makes smart overlapping runs and can cross the ball directly to Bayern's forwards in the opposition box. What makes his ability even more impressive is that he can cross the ball even while it is moving. Thus, he doesn't need to make unnecessary pauses that will give a chance for opposing defenders to tackle the ball away from him. Even though Cancelo's defensive abilities aren't exceptional, his offensive output as a fullback has brought Bayern many goals and allowed the team to have a full control over the game in offensive phases.</p>
