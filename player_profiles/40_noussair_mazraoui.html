            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Noussair Mazraoui is a very balanced fullback who can play as both LB and RB. Even though he is not currently favored as Bayern's starter in any of these positions, he is a solid backup. Mazraoui is more offense-oriented, but is also good defensively. He is not particularly fast, especially for a fullback, but he makes up for his lack of pace with his dependable defensive fundamentals. He can track back and man-mark opponents, making sure they don't get too much free space to be dangerous. Additionally, he is tall enough to be able to head the ball away after opposing crosses. In offense, Mazraoui demonstrates good dribbling and crossing ability. He gets creative with his passing and can either dribble into the opposition box or instantly find a teammate who is already in there. What makes Mazraoui unique, however, is his versatility. He can play on any side of the field and still deliver respectable performances. He can also play in midfield, as his large arsenal of skills make him effective in the middle of the pitch as well. Nevertheless, Mazraoui lacks mastery and eccentricity to make it into the starting 11. He is solid at many traits, but exceptional at none. Thus, at this point in his career at Bayern, he has only been useful as a backup player rather than a starting fullback.</p>
