            <h2>Play Style</h2>
            <p>Ryan Gravenberch is a box-to-box midfielder who relies on his versatility and stamina to control the middle of the pitch. He is one of the youngest players in Bayern and was signed to grow into Bayern's midfield. Even though he doesn't get lots of playing time, Bayern fans were still able to see flashes of brilliance in his style of play. In contrast to other box-to-box midfielders, Gravenberch has remarkable dribbling skills. He is not just someone who provides physical dominance to Bayern's midfield. He uses his dribbling to control the game retain possession for the team. This adds a creative edge to Bayern's style of play in offensive phases, as Gravenberch is able to create dangerous chances with his footwork alone. Additionally, his dribbling skills make him a good outlet when the opposition pressures Bayern. He can easily leave his marker behind, progressing the ball forward and dissolving the press. Defensively, Gravenberch has all the aspects to be an all-round midfielder. He is tall and strong, which means he has the potential to out-muscle opposing players and physically dominate the midfield. However, since he is young, he doesn't quite show his full potential in this aspect of the game. Whether he lacks confidence or experience to use his athleticism, it is something that he can learn and improve upon with time. Fulfilling his physical potential will allow him to greater contribute to Bayern's defense and maybe even secure a spot in the starting 11 of Bayern Munich.</p>
